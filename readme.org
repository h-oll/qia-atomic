* Purpose
- Identify repeated atomic tasks in protocols
- Code the most useful of them
- Discuss the opportunity of including these tasks into the hardware that is being built

* Methodology
- Review the protocol zoo
- Identify the atomic tasks for each protocol
- Affect the atomic task into categories
  - Ntework stage
  - Complexity of the task
  - Layer
  - Speed
- Map the various tasks in a KG and find which are useful


* Results
** Protocol list + identified atomic tasks
** Task categorization
** KG
** Software implementation recommendations
** Hardware integration recommendations
