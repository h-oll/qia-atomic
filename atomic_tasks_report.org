#+TITLE: Quantum Internet Alliance M4.2: List of atomic tasks
#+DATE:2020-02-24
#+AUTHOR: H. Ollivier

* Purpose
Application level protocols need to have access to networking services such as entanglement sharing between any two points of the network. While such service is at the heart of the quantum internet architecture, additional functionalities can be required or just convenient to have for better, faster, wider development of application level protocols. 

The purpose of this report is to review a wide range of such protocols searching for atomic repeatable functions while categorising them along several dimensions. By doing so, we aim at providing building blocks that:
- lessen the amount of code and control needed while developing applications for the quantum internet (in particular through code reuse);
- allow benchmarking of the nodes and network capabilities against these tasks;
- provide functionalities with sound cryptographic definitions;
- provide a simulation platform where these functions would already be implemented, to further accelerate the creation cycle of quantum protocols.

* Methodology
1. Review of the quantum protocol zoo looking at the various protocols;
2. Identify and group candidate atomic functions;
3. Categorising various candidates into network stages, type (quantum internet layer attribution, off-layer), and necessity
4. Integration into protocol zoo's knowledge graph

* Review of the quantum protocol zoo

* Task extraction
** Sending qubit
This functionality should be provided at the transport layer for entanglement sharing networks. It would be at the link layer for networks based on direct transmission of quantum informaton (QKD-like networks).

For a transport layer functionality, it is expected to provide reliable service with flow control (allowing the sender to improve its probability of correct transmission by detecting possible congestion at the receiving end or along the way). 

** Sending qubit blocks
Same as previous functionality but handling several qubits in a single call.

** Teleportation protocol
While teleportation is the heart of the transport layer in entanglement sharing networks, it is useful to have each half of the protocol available directly to the programmer as a way to teleport while quantum one time padding information. This is especially useful in measurement based quantum computation for blindness and verification. In this case, teleportation measurement is performed, but the sender does not send the corrections to the receiver.

** Creation and braodcast of GHZ state                                 
GHZ states are central to several multi-party protocols. Several implementations can be proposed:
- either a centralized create and broadcast operation using a regular transport layer, 
- or tapping directly into the network layer for using bipartite entanglement as a way to generate the GHZ state in a decentralized fashion. 

The first option would yield two atomic sub-tasks, while the latter would involve a protocol on its own.

** Creation and broadcast of any stabilizer state
Same.

** Creation and broadcast of arbitrary graph states
Same.

** Quantum One Time Pad / confidential channel (encoding and decoding)
Encoding and decoding are identical, yielding a single atomic task that is entirely performed locally. The "send" part can be performed using the send qubit atomic function and would yield a confidential quantum channel. It can also be implemented directly via teleportation.

** BB84 Encoding of classical data
One of the most useful encoding. It is used in many protocols and is also helpful in unittesting the library itself. This would be naturally embedded in a slightly more general preparation functionality where all 6 states that are eigenstates of Pauli operators can be prepared at will.

** BB84 Decoding to classical data
Same reason. Symmetric functionality.

** Single Qubit Preparation in equatorial plane (finite set of angles)
Useful in the context of measurement based quantum computing. The set of preparation angles is $\{\frac{k\pi}{4}\}_{0\leq k \leq 7}$.

** Single Qubit Measurement in equatorial plane (finite set of angles)
Same reason. Symmetric functionality.

** Multi qubit POVM
While it is not possible to allow the implementation of generic POVM's even on a few qubits, some should be available readily as atomic functions. A possibility would be to allow for POVM's obtained as observables defined by stabilizer measurements as it would allow completing basic quantum error correcting schemes.

** Local Pauli gates
Necessary. Mostly provided by the backend it self.

** Local Clifford gates
Same.

** Non Clifford gates
Most backends or hardware provide the ability to perform $T$ gates. These will serve as building blocks for distillation schemes before being used in real circuits.

** Local memory manager
The idea behind this functionality is to be able to handle various scenario influencing the robustness of protocols, such as being able to tell neighboring nodes that the capacity to accept new qubits is low before they actually send information. It might also be interesting to be able to keep track of the time to live of various qubits so that other parts of the protocols can take that into account and give higher priority to operations with a lower TTL. 

The implementation of such functionality can be done in various ways and will highly depend on the backend and chosen architecture.

** Multi-site verification of stabilizer state
This allows verified multiparty protocols. It also enters into unit testing for multi-party operations.

** QFactory
Remote preparation of a classical described quantum state.

** Swap Test
Implies to add the swap gate first and then the test. It should work indistinctively for individual qubits and blocks of qubits.

** Privacy amplification / Information reconciliation
Useful for QKD. Should be decomposed into smaller steps so that one has the possibility to chose among the various code parameters used in these schemes.

** Classical error correction
Many protocols require being able to perform classical error correction at a very fine grained level (be it for exploiting classical code properties in algorithms or to have manual control over some quantum error correction schemes using CSS codes. This entry corresponds to a sub-library providing encoding, error estimation and decoding procedures as well as code manipulation functionalities. Depending on the use of these codes (either as being used off-line or on-line) they should provide fast implementations (possibly requiring dedicated libraries or even dedicated hardware).

** Quantum 1-way function
Used in digital signature schemes and quantum cheques. This function takes a classical bit, a key and outputs a block of qubits that encode the classical bit with the help of a classical key $k$.

** Secure classical broadcast channel
Specific implementation could be required for high precision timing reasons.

** Classical authenticated channel      
Same.

** Quantum anonymous transmission channel      
Same. 

** Quantum Authenticated Channel 
Same.

** Weak Coin Flipping
Protocol per se, but used as a component in other protocols.

** Verifiable Quantum Secret Sharing
Same.


* Task categorisation
Each task is categorized in the layer model of quantum networks (ie. Physical, Layer, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application or Off layer). The Network stage is also specified for each of these atomic functions (ie. in increasing complexity starting from trusted repeaters, entanglement distribution, quantum memory and quantum computing).
